### A Comprehensive Repository for Coursework

This repository contains all the laboratory assignments and the final project for the **Object-Oriented Programming 2** course taken during the Fall 2025-26 semester. The solutions are developed in C# using the .NET framework and Visual Studio.

### 📚 What's Inside?

This repository is organized to clearly separate lab work from the final project.

*   **🧪 Lab Assignments (`/Lab`)**: Contains solutions for all weekly lab tasks. Each lab is designed to practice specific OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, and design patterns.
*   **🏗️ Final Project (`/Project`)**: A complete application that integrates the major concepts and skills learned throughout the course. This section includes the source code, documentation, and any other required assets for the final project.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/OOP2-FALL-2025-26.git
    cd OOP2-FALL-2025-26
    ```

2.  **Navigate to a project directory:**
    ```sh
    # Example for a lab task
    cd Lab/LabTask1/

    # Or for the final project
    cd Project/
    ```

3.  **Open the Solution in Visual Studio:**
    *   Find the `.sln` file (e.g., `labTask1.sln`) in the project's root directory.
    *   Double-click the file to open it in Visual Studio.

4.  **Build and Run the Project:**
    *   Once the solution is loaded, ensure the correct project is set as the "Startup Project" by right-clicking it in the Solution Explorer and selecting `Set as Startup Project`.
